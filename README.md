# Aepp Angular Boilerplate

This boilerplate is designed to allow everyone an easy start when building an aepp on 
top of the aeternity eco system. It contains two critical parts:

- Easy wallet discovery
- The [aeternity js-sdk](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js) instance

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Get started

Clone repo via git or use the template button above.

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server

testnet

```bash
npm run start:testnet
```

mainnet

```bash
npm run start:mainnet
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
